# OpenCloud Helm Charts

Welcome to the **OpenCloud Helm Charts** repository! This repository is intended as a community-driven space for developing and maintaining Helm charts for deploying OpenCloud on Kubernetes.

## ðŸš€ About

This repository is created to **welcome contributions from the community**. It does not contain official charts from OpenCloud GmbH and is **not officially supported by OpenCloud GmbH**. Instead, these charts are maintained by the open-source community.

> **Note:** The current Helm charts are designed for local development and testing purposes only. They lack several features required for production deployments such as resource management, security configurations, and high availability options. See the [Getting Started with macOS](docs/getting-started-macos.md) guide for detailed information.

## ðŸ“¦ Installing the Helm Charts

Currently only deployment from the file system is supported:

```
$ helm install opencloud -n opencloud --create-namespace ./charts/opencloud --set=adminPassword="<MY-SECURE-PASSWORD>" --set=url="<PUBLIC-URL>"
```

It is important the the public-url is reachable, and forwarded to the backend-service opencloud-service:443,
otherwise login will not be possible or the message "missing or invalid config" is shown.

An example ingress for nginx with cert-manager annotations is in ./inwork/opencloud-ingress.yaml.


For testing with the default settings port-forwarding from localhost can be used:

```
$ helm install opencloud -n opencloud --create-namespace ./charts/opencloud

  Release "opencloud" does not exist. Installing it now.
  NAME: opencloud
  LAST DEPLOYED: Wed Apr  2 01:16:19 2025
  NAMESPACE: opencloud
  STATUS: deployed
  REVISION: 1
  TEST SUITE: None
```

Establish a port-forwarding from localhost

```
$ kubectl port-forward -n opencloud svc/opencloud-service 9200:443

  Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:9200 -> 9200
  Forwarding from [::1]:9200 -> 9200
  ...
```

Now open in a browser the url: [https://localhost:9200](https://localhost:9200) while 
the port forwarding is active.

You need to accept the risc of a self signed certificate.
(see [Common Issues & Help](https://docs.opencloud.eu/docs/admin/getting-started/docker/#troubleshooting)) in 
the getting started with Docker documentation.

Now you can login with the default admin / admin

If you want to change the public URL you can upgrade the deployment with the following command:

```
$ helm upgrade opencloud -n opencloud ./charts/opencloud --set=url="<NEW-PUBLIC-URL>"

  Release "opencloud" has been upgraded. Happy Helming!
  NAME: opencloud
  LAST DEPLOYED: Wed Apr  2 01:42:51 2025
  NAMESPACE: opencloud
  STATUS: deployed
  REVISION: 2
  TEST SUITE: None
```

The opencloud deployment will be restarted and is availble after a few seconds configured for the new url.

If you want to uninstall opencloud this can be done with 

ATTENTION: all you data will be lost, PVCs are not kept at the moment.

```
$ helm uninstall -n opencloud opencloud

  release "opencloud" uninstalled
```
